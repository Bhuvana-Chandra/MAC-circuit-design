# MAC-circuit-design
- Developed a VHDL-based MAC circuit in Quartus multiplying two 8-bit operands and adding a 16-bit number
- Implemented using an 8x8 AND gate array, Dadda scheme for bit reduction, and a logarithmic adder
- Successfully simulated and tested in ModelSim-Altera, verifying correct operation with 10 different input test case
